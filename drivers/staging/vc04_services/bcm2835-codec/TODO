1) Convert to be a platform driver.

Right now when the module probes, it tries to initialize VCHI and
errors out if it wasn't ready yet.  If bcm2835-v4l2 was built in, then
VCHI generally isn't ready because it depends on both the firmware and
mailbox drivers having already loaded.

We should have VCHI create a platform device once it's initialized,
and have this driver bind to it, so that we automatically load the
v4l2 module after VCHI loads.

2) Support SELECTION API to define crop region on the image for encode.

Particularly for resolutions that aren't a multiple of the macroblock
size, the codec will report a resolution that is a multiple of the macroblock
size (it has to have the memory to decode into), and then a different crop
region within that buffer.
The most common example is 1080P, where the buffer will be 1920x1088 with a
crop region of 1920x1080.

3) Refactor so that the component creation is only on queue_setup, not open.

Fixes v4l2-compliance failure on trying to open 100 instances of the
device.
