	  These are normally selected implicitely when including a
	  DRM module, but for GKI, the modules are built out-of-tree.

# Atrocities needed for
# a) building GKI modules in separate tree, or
# b) building drivers that are not modularizable
#
# All of these should be reworked into an upstream solution
# if possible.

	  built from a different config, say N here.
